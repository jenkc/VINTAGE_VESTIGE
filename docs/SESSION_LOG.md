## Session Log: 2026-03-07 — Multi-Dimensional Bridge Classification + Social Function Explorer API

### What Was Accomplished

**Multi-Dimensional Bridge Classification (replaces `semantic_type`):**
- Designed and implemented 6-column classification system replacing the single overloaded `semantic_type` column on StyleBridge
- 6 new columns: `temporal_type`, `crossing_type`, `connection_mode`, `primary_axis`, `secondary_axis`, `contrast_pair`
- Started with 5 connection modes (citation/echo/parallel/contrast/kinship), then **simplified to 3 sharp modes**: contrast, resonance, affinity — after critique identified echo was too broad, parallel too rare, and citation couldn't detect intentionality
- 9 opposition pairs across 4 aesthetic axes (volume, ornament, body, register) for contrast detection
- Classifier script built, tested, and ready to run post-bridge-computation

**Social Function Explorer API:**
- New `/explore` router with 2 endpoints for browsing products by social function
- `shared_function` filter added to existing `/bridges/top` endpoint for "Same Question, Different Answers" view
- Uses PostgreSQL `jsonb` containment operators for efficient JSON array querying

**Narrative Pipeline Update:**
- `generate_bridge_narrative_async()` now accepts `connection_mode` and `contrast_pair`
- Mode-specific prompt hints: contrast bridges explain tension, resonance bridges explain echoes, affinity bridges use existing generic prompt
- `generate_narratives.py` fetches and threads the new fields through

**Test Updates:**
- Updated `test_bridge_classification.py` for 3-mode system (deleted echo/parallel/kinship tests, added resonance/affinity/contrast-beats-resonance tests)

**KG Plan Updates:**
- Updated 5 KG implementation plan docs to reflect 6-dimension model

### Files Created This Session

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/classify_bridge_dimensions.py` | Multi-dimensional bridge classifier (330 lines) |
| `tests/unit/test_bridge_classification.py` | Unit tests for classifier (414 lines) |
| `analysis/product_queries.py` | Social function query helpers (JSON containment queries) |
| `api/routers/explore.py` | Explore router (`/explore/functions`, `/explore/functions/{fn}`) |
| `api/schemas/explore.py` | Pydantic schemas for explore endpoints |
| `docs/plans/FRONTEND_UPDATES.md` | Proposed frontend changes for new API endpoints |

### Files Modified This Session

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `storage/database.py` | Added 6 new columns to StyleBridge model |
| `analysis/bridge_queries.py` | Added 6 fields to BridgeResult/build/filters + `shared_function` filter with jsonb query + `text` import |
| `api/routers/bridges.py` | Added `temporal_type`, `crossing_type`, `connection_mode`, `primary_axis`, `shared_function` query params |
| `api/schemas/bridge.py` | Added 6 new optional fields to BridgeResult Pydantic schema |
| `enrichment/claude.py` | Added `connection_mode`/`contrast_pair` params to `generate_bridge_narrative_async()` with mode hint logic |
| `analysis/generate_narratives.py` | Fetches `connection_mode`/`contrast_pair` from bridges, passes through to enricher |
| `api/main.py` | Registered explore router |
| `docs/plans/KG_IMPLEMENTATION/KG_PHASE1_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md` | Replaced semantic_type with 6-dimension model |
| `docs/plans/KG_IMPLEMENTATION/KG_PHASE0_PREREQUISITES.md` | Updated classifier reference |
| `docs/plans/KG_IMPLEMENTATION/KG_PHASE4_EXPORT_SCRIPTS.md` | Updated export to 6 columns |
| `docs/plans/KG_IMPLEMENTATION/KG_PHASE7_FRONTEND.md` | Updated color coding to 3 modes |
| `docs/plans/KG_IMPLEMENTATION/KG_DECISIONS.md` | Rewrote KGD-005 for 6-dimension model |

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| 6 orthogonal dimensions over single `semantic_type` | Can't filter "all contrast bridges that are also cross-cultural transmissions" with a single column |
| 3 connection modes (contrast/resonance/affinity) over 5 | Echo was "not kinship" rather than something specific; parallel was too rare; citation can't detect intentionality from embeddings |
| Contrast priority over resonance | Opposing vibes on same structural axis is more interesting than high text similarity |
| Post-hoc classifier (not integrated into compute_bridges) | Bridge computation is already complex; classification is a separate concern that runs after |
| Include bridge_vibes in contrast/resonance detection | bridge_vibes are "secondary aesthetic tendencies" — excluding them misses valid oppositions |
| New `/explore` router (not extending `/products`) | Social function exploration is conceptually different from single-product CRUD; will grow with technique/motif explorers |
| `jsonb` containment for social_function queries | `social_function::jsonb @> '["wedding"]'::jsonb` is efficient and indexable |

### Problems Hit

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `classify_crossing_type` signature had 3 args but tests expected 2 | Dropped `bridge` param — function doesn't use it |
| Mode hint code placed inside f-string | Moved logic above the f-string, interpolate `{mode_hint}` variable |
| `bindparams()` closing paren misaligned in shared_function filter | Fixed indentation so bindparams closes before filter |

### What's Left Open

- **`compute_bridges.py --rebuild` still running** — classifier can't run until it finishes
- **Classifier dry-run** — `venv/bin/python scripts/classify_bridge_dimensions.py --dry-run` (pending bridge completion)
- **Generate narratives** — after classifier populates connection_mode, new narratives will get mode-specific hints
- **Supabase ALTER TABLE** — 6 new columns added to style_bridges (done this session)
- **Frontend updates** — documented in `docs/plans/FRONTEND_UPDATES.md`, not yet implemented

RESUME POINT: Wait for `compute_bridges.py` to finish → run classifier dry-run → review distribution → full classifier run → generate narratives. Frontend updates are planned but not started.

## Session Log: 2026-03-06 — Async Enrichment Pipeline + Embedding Script Fixes + Bug Fixes

### What Was Accomplished

**Bug Fixes:**
- **f-string bug in `enrichment/claude.py`** — `{"term": confidence_float}` inside f-strings on lines 332 and 405 was being parsed as a format specifier. Fixed by doubling braces: `{{"term": confidence_float}}`. This was causing most enrichment calls to fail (only 70/3298 succeeded before fix).
- **Stale print/docstrings in `analysis/compute_bridges.py`** — Updated "3 passes" → "2 passes" after the cross_category pass was removed in a prior session. Updated module docstring, function docstring, and runtime print.

**New Enrichment Scripts:**
- **`enrichment/enrich_async.py`** — Async concurrent enrichment using `asyncio.Semaphore` for bounded concurrency. 5x speedup over sequential. Supports `--limit=N`, `--concurrency=N`, `--yes`. Prints progress every 10 completions with rate and ETA. Does NOT generate embeddings (user runs those separately).
- **`enrichment/enrich_batch.py`** — Message Batches API enrichment (50% cost reduction). Submit/poll workflow. Ultimately user chose async approach for real-time feedback.

**Embedding Script Updates:**
- **`embeddings/generator.py`** — `generate_embeddings_for_database()` now uses `enriched_text` (with fallback to title+description) instead of raw title+description. Filter changed from `embedded_at == None` to `enriched_at != None, text_embedding == None`. Also generates image embeddings inline if missing.

**Enrichment Progress:**
- User ran multiple batches of 300 products using `enrich_async.py`
- Enrichment count: 866 → **1,490** (624 new products enriched this session)
- Text embeddings: 866 → **1,190** (324 new)
- 624 products now have `core_vibes` (new vibe vocabulary fields)

**Architecture Discussion:**
- Discussed multimodal embedding fusion approaches (early fusion, concatenation, learned projection)
- Decided to keep current late fusion approach (separate text + image vectors, combined at bridge scoring) — better for fashion domain because "looks similar" and "means similar" are different signals

### Files Created This Session

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `enrichment/enrich_async.py` | Async concurrent enrichment (asyncio, semaphore-bounded) |
| `enrichment/enrich_batch.py` | Message Batches API enrichment (50% cost, submit/poll) |

### Files Modified This Session

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `enrichment/claude.py` | Fixed f-string bug: `{}` → `{{}}` for vibe_scores on lines 332, 405 |
| `analysis/compute_bridges.py` | Updated docstrings + print: "3 passes" → "2 passes" |
| `embeddings/generator.py` | `generate_embeddings_for_database()`: use enriched_text, changed filter, inline image embedding |

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Keep separate text + image embeddings (no fusion) | Late fusion at bridge scoring preserves MiniLM semantic richness + CLIP visual similarity as independent signals |
| Async concurrent over Batch API for enrichment | User prefers real-time feedback; async is 5x faster; batch saves 50% cost but has 24hr turnaround |
| Embedding generation stays separate from enrichment | User's established workflow — enrich first, embed after |
| Use enriched_text for text embeddings (not title+description) | enriched_text contains 23 enrichment fields → richer semantic signal |

### Problems Hit

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `Invalid format specifier ' confidence_float'` in f-string | Doubled braces: `{{"term": confidence_float}}` in claude.py |
| No progress output from async script | Added shared counter dict, prints every 10 completions with rate/ETA |
| Old embeddings used title+description, not enriched_text | Updated `generate_embeddings_for_database()` filter and text source |

### What's Left Open

- **~2,744 products still unenriched** (1,490/4,234 done)
- **~3,044 products missing text embeddings** (1,190/4,234 done)
- **~3,368 products missing image embeddings** (866/4,234 done)
- **Old 866 products** embedded from title+description (not enriched_text) — should be re-embedded
- **Bridges need recomputation** after enrichment + embedding completes (`compute_bridges.py --rebuild`)
- **Unrecognized eras** — review CSV after enrichment completes, add aliases

RESUME POINT: User is running enrichment batches of 300 via `enrich_async.py`. After enrichment completes: run embedding generation → recompute bridges → review era taxonomy.

## Session Log: 2026-03-04 — Supabase Migration (Steps 5-11 of 20) + IIT Todoist CSV

### What Was Accomplished

**Supabase Migration Progress (Steps 5-11 complete):**

Continuing the Supabase migration plan at `.claude/plans/zazzy-seeking-falcon.md`. Steps 1-4 were completed in a prior session (enable pgvector, create storage bucket, pg_dump/restore, update .env). This session completed:

- **Step 5: Image migration** — All 4,234 products migrated from base64 `data:image/...` → Supabase Storage URLs (`https://tusswxlrdoamintvswjs.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/product-images/{id}.jpg`). Zero base64 remaining.
- **Step 6: Qdrant → pgvector embedding migration** — 866 text embeddings + 866 image embeddings migrated from local Qdrant to pgvector columns. HNSW indexes created. Verified similarity queries work. Local Qdrant stopped and `QDRANT_HOST`/`QDRANT_PORT` removed from `.env`.
- **Step 7: ORM model update** — Added `from pgvector.sqlalchemy import Vector` and two columns (`text_embedding Vector(384)`, `image_embedding Vector(512)`) to Product class in `storage/database.py`.
- **Step 8: Vector search module** — Created `storage/vector_search.py` with `VectorSearch` class (4 methods: `search_text`, `search_image`, `get_embedding`, `upsert_embedding`). Takes SQLAlchemy Session instead of managing Qdrant connection.
- **Step 9: API dependencies** — Rewrote `api/dependencies.py` to use `VectorSearch` instead of old `VectorDB`.
- **Step 10: Search router** — Rewrote `api/routers/search.py` to use `VectorSearch` + pgvector instead of Qdrant.
- **Step 11: Search schema validators** — Added `@field_validator` to `SearchResult` in `api/schemas/search.py` to parse JSON strings from SQL for `style_tags` and `colors` fields.

**IIT 4.0 Todoist CSV:**
- Created comprehensive task list at `docs/IIT_4.0_TODOIST_TASKS.csv` with ~130 tasks across 8 sections, 3 indent levels, ready for Todoist CSV import.

### Files Created This Session

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `storage/vector_search.py` | pgvector-backed VectorSearch class (replaces `storage/vector_db.py`) |
| `docs/IIT_4.0_TODOIST_TASKS.csv` | 130-task Todoist import file for IIT 4.0 implementation |

### Files Modified This Session

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `storage/database.py` | Added pgvector Vector import + text_embedding/image_embedding columns |
| `api/dependencies.py` | Swapped VectorDB → VectorSearch, removed Qdrant dependency |
| `api/routers/search.py` | Full rewrite: Qdrant → pgvector VectorSearch |
| `api/schemas/search.py` | Added `parse_json_lists` field_validator for style_tags/colors |
| `scripts/migrate_qdrant_to_pgvector.py` | User-written migration script (fixed: function signature, `==` vs `=`, collection name `vintage_images` plural) |
| `.env` | Removed QDRANT_HOST, QDRANT_PORT |

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| pgvector over Qdrant Cloud | Single database (Supabase) for everything — simpler ops, both embeddings on same row simplifies Φ calculation |
| VectorSearch takes Session (not own connection) | Shares request's DB session — no separate vector DB connection to manage |
| Keep `storage/vector_db.py` for now | Will delete in Step 16 after all references are updated |

### Problems Hit

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Qdrant collection name mismatch: `vintage_image` vs `vintage_images` | Collection was `vintage_images` (plural) — fixed in migration script |
| `_build_filter_dict` logic inverted (`if not filters:` then used `filters`) | Fixed: early return `None` when no filters |
| Typo `pgvector.sqalchemy` (missing 'l') | Fixed to `pgvector.sqlalchemy` |
| Typo `b64dercode` | Fixed to `b64decode` |
| Typo `.itemns()` | Fixed to `.items()` |
| Similarity query returned no rows | Product ID 1 didn't exist — used subquery to find any product with embeddings |

### What's Left Open

- **Steps 12-20 of Supabase migration** remain:
  - Step 12: Update compute_bridges.py (biggest remaining file — swap Qdrant for pgvector queries)
  - Step 13: Update embeddings/generator.py (handle URL images)
  - Step 14: Update enrichment/claude.py
  - Step 15: Update enrichment scripts
  - Step 16: Delete obsolete files (vector_db.py, etc.)
  - Step 17: Update frontend (next.config.ts image domains)
  - Step 18: Update tests
  - Step 19-20: Verify + cleanup

RESUME POINT: Start Step 12 (compute_bridges.py). User is writing all code themselves — walk through each step, check their work, flag bugs.

## Session Log: 2026-02-27 — Frontend Polish COMPLETE + Database Growth Plan + Deployment Discussion

### What Was Accomplished

**Frontend Polish (Step 10 — COMPLETE):**

All polish items finished. TypeScript check and `npm run build` both pass clean. All 4 routes compile:
- `/` — static, revalidates every hour
- `/about` — static
- `/search` — static (client-side data fetching)
- `/product/[id]` — dynamic (server-rendered per request)

Polish items completed:
- **Error boundaries**: `global-error.tsx` (root-level, with `<html>`/`<body>` tags), `error.tsx` (page-level for home), `product/[id]/loading.tsx` already existed
- **ImageWithFallback swap**: Replaced `next/image` with `ImageWithFallback` in BridgeCardFull, BridgeCardCompact, ProductCard. Kept ternary fallbacks as belt-and-suspenders.
- **Search error handling**: Added `error` state, catch block, and error display to search page
- **Home data caching**: `export const revalidate = 3600` (1-hour ISR)
- **Scroll snap**: `snap-x snap-mandatory` on carousels (home + product detail), `snap-start` on BridgeCardCompact
- **Mobile touch targets**: Search submit button enlarged to `size-11` (44px) for WCAG 2.5.5
- **Mobile search UX**: `autoFocus={!searchParams.get("q")}` — focuses input only when no existing query
- **SEO metadata**: Static `metadata` export on about page, dynamic `generateMetadata` on product detail page (title, description, OpenGraph image)
- **Accessibility**: `role="img" aria-label` on ScoreCircle, `role="search" aria-label` on search form, `aria-label="Submit search"` on button, `role="region" aria-label` on carousel containers
- **Loading skeleton**: Created `loading.tsx` for home page (hero + how-it-works shimmer)
- **CSS cleanup**: Confirmed no legacy `vintage-*` classes remain

**Database Growth Plan (866 → 1,500 products):**
- Analyzed all 3 data loaders and enrichment pipeline to plan growth
- Created 6-phase plan at `.claude/plans/functional-hopping-barto.md`
- Strategy: maximize free API data before Claude enrichment
- Target distribution: Fashionpedia 750, Met 400, Smithsonian 350
- Estimated cost: ~$27 (~$14 with Batch API)
- Bridge scaling analysis: confirmed linear growth due to `top_n` caps per product

**Backend Deployment Discussion:**
- Covered deployment options: Railway (all-in-one), Vercel+Render+Supabase+Qdrant Cloud (mix-and-match), Fly.io
- Explained key deployment concepts: env vars, build vs runtime, health checks, cold starts, CORS
- Recommended starting with: Qdrant Cloud (free 1GB) + Supabase (free Postgres) + Railway (FastAPI) + Vercel (Next.js)
- User decided to grow dataset before deploying (richer content = better first impression)

### Files Created This Session

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `vv-web/src/app/global-error.tsx` | Root-level error boundary (replaces root layout) |
| `vv-web/src/app/error.tsx` | Home page error boundary |
| `vv-web/src/app/loading.tsx` | Home page loading skeleton (Skeleton shimmer) |
| `.claude/plans/functional-hopping-barto.md` | Database growth plan: 866 → 1,500 products |

### Files Modified This Session

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `vv-web/src/app/page.tsx` | Added `revalidate = 3600`, `snap-x snap-mandatory`, `role="region" aria-label` |
| `vv-web/src/app/search/page.tsx` | Added error state + display, 44px touch target, autoFocus, `role="search"`, `aria-label` |
| `vv-web/src/app/product/[id]/page.tsx` | Added `generateMetadata` (title, description, OG image), `snap-x snap-mandatory`, `role="region" aria-label` |
| `vv-web/src/app/about/page.tsx` | Added static `metadata` export (title + description) |
| `vv-web/src/components/bridge/BridgeCardFull.tsx` | Swapped `Image` → `ImageWithFallback` |
| `vv-web/src/components/bridge/BridgeCardCompact.tsx` | Swapped `Image` → `ImageWithFallback`, added `snap-start` |
| `vv-web/src/components/bridge/ScoreCircle.tsx` | Added `role="img"` + `aria-label` |
| `vv-web/src/components/search/ProductCard.tsx` | Swapped `Image` → `ImageWithFallback` |

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Keep ternary fallbacks alongside ImageWithFallback | Belt-and-suspenders: ImageWithFallback handles load errors, ternary handles missing URLs |
| Search page doesn't need `loading.tsx` | Client component manages its own loading state with `useState` |
| `revalidate = 3600` for home page | 1-hour ISR cache — bridges don't change often, avoids per-request DB calls |
| 44px touch targets (`size-11`) | WCAG 2.5.5 minimum target size for mobile accessibility |
| `autoFocus` only when no existing query | Prevents keyboard popping up when returning to search with results |
| Grow dataset before deploying | Sparse data = empty pages = bad first impression |
| Target 1,500 products for growth | Balances content density vs Claude API cost (~$27) |
| Fashionpedia-heavy distribution (750/1500) | Expert-annotated taxonomy = cheaper enrichment ($0.015 vs $0.03/item) |
| `"use client"` pages can't export `metadata` | Next.js constraint — root layout's default title applies instead |

### Problems Hit

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `npx tsc --noEmit` failed — `npx` not found | Prepended PATH: `export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin:$PATH"` |
| Port 8000 already in use | Backend was already running from a previous session (PID 17312) |

### What's Left Open

- **Database growth**: Plan documented at `.claude/plans/functional-hopping-barto.md` — user will implement themselves
- **Deployment**: Discussed options but not started — user wants data density first
- **Image search frontend**: Backend API exists but no frontend implementation yet
- **Bridge narratives**: Still 22/7,324 generated — will be addressed during Phase 6 of growth plan

RESUME POINT: User is implementing the database growth plan (Phase 1: load data from all 3 sources, then Phases 2-6). After data growth, deployment is next.

## Session Log: 2026-02-25 (cont.) — Frontend Phase 3B Search + Phase 3C Bridge Components (1-7)

### What Was Accomplished

**Frontend Phase 3B — Search Components (COMPLETE):**
- **3B.1 SearchBar.tsx** — `"use client"`, debounced text input (400ms), Enter for immediate search, clear button (X/Search icon swap), large/compact variants
- **3B.2 ImageUpload.tsx** — `"use client"`, drag-and-drop + file picker, FileReader base64 conversion, preview with X overlay, mobile Camera/desktop Upload icons
- **3B.3 ProductCard.tsx** — Server component, union type `CardData = SearchResult | ProductSummary`, next/Image with `fill` + `sizes`, platform badge with inline color, era badge, match %, gradient placeholder for missing images, `group-hover:scale-105` image zoom

**Frontend Phase 3C — Bridge Components (7 of 10 done):**
- **3C.1 PlatformBadge.tsx** — Frosted-glass pill, runtime platform color from PLATFORM_COLORS
- **3C.2 EraBadge.tsx** — Dark translucent pill, "Era · date" format with middle dot separator
- **3C.3 ScoreCircle.tsx** — Circular match display (44px mobile / 52px desktop), color from `scoreColorByValue()`
- **3C.4 BridgeConnector.tsx** — Gold circle with ArrowLeftRight icon, full/compact variants
- **3C.5 AttributePill.tsx** — Shared DNA pill with two-tone label/value typography, sage color scheme
- **3C.6 NarrativeBlock.tsx** — Blockquote with gold left border, italic serif text
- **3C.7 ScoreBreakdown.tsx** — Three horizontal bars (semantic/visual/structural), `BARS` array with `.map()`, skips null image similarity, 60% opacity fills

**Type fix:**
- Added `platform: string` to `SearchResult` interface in `types/index.ts` — was missing, causing TS error in ProductCard union type

### Files Created This Session

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `vv-web/src/components/bridge/PlatformBadge.tsx` | Frosted-glass platform pill |
| `vv-web/src/components/bridge/EraBadge.tsx` | Dark translucent era pill |
| `vv-web/src/components/bridge/ScoreCircle.tsx` | Circular match percentage |
| `vv-web/src/components/bridge/BridgeConnector.tsx` | Gold exchange icon circle |
| `vv-web/src/components/bridge/AttributePill.tsx` | Shared DNA attribute pill |
| `vv-web/src/components/bridge/NarrativeBlock.tsx` | AI narrative quote block |
| `vv-web/src/components/bridge/ScoreBreakdown.tsx` | Three-bar score visualization |

### Files Modified This Session

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `vv-web/src/components/search/SearchBar.tsx` | Populated: debounced search with large/compact variants |
| `vv-web/src/components/search/ImageUpload.tsx` | Populated: drag-drop + file picker with base64 conversion |
| `vv-web/src/components/search/ProductCard.tsx` | Populated: product card with image, platform badge, era, score |
| `vv-web/src/types/index.ts` | Added `platform: string` to SearchResult |

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| ProductCard accepts `SearchResult \| ProductSummary` union | Reusable in both search results and bridge displays |
| ProductCard uses `hasScore()` type guard | Distinguishes SearchResult (has `score`) from ProductSummary at runtime |
| Platform badge uses inline `style` not Tailwind class | Color comes from JS object at runtime — can't be a static class |
| ScoreBreakdown appends `99` hex to color for 60% opacity | `${bar.color}99` is simpler than a separate opacity layer |
| ProductCard is server component (no `"use client"`) | Purely presentational — no hooks or state needed |
| `ArrowLeftRight` from lucide-react for BridgeConnector | Matches the spec's double-arrow icon without custom SVG |
| Frontend page route `/product/[id]` (singular) | URL slug convention for viewing one resource; API uses plural `/products/` per REST |

### Problems Hit

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `product.name` doesn't exist on types | Changed to `product.title` |
| `import { match } from "assert"` auto-inserted | Removed — VS Code autocomplete artifact |
| `defalultValue` typo in SearchBar | Fixed to `defaultValue` |
| `debouncedSearch` missing setTimeout body | Added `debounceRef.current = setTimeout(() => onSearch(query), 400)` |
| `SearchResult` missing `platform` field | Added `platform: string` to SearchResult interface |
| ScoreBreakdown inner div missing `h-full rounded-full` | Added classes — without them, fill bar has zero height |
| ScoreBreakdown `/ >` syntax error | Fixed to `/>` |

### What's Left Open

- **BridgeCardFull.tsx** — empty stub, next to implement
- **BridgeCardCompact.tsx** — empty stub
- **bridge/index.ts** — barrel export file not yet created
- **Phase 3D** — Skeleton.tsx, ImageWithFallback.tsx
- **Phases 4-5** — Pages + polish

RESUME POINT: Start Phase 3C.8 BridgeCardFull (the big composition component), then BridgeCardCompact, index.ts barrel, then 3D utilities.

## Session Log: 2026-02-25 — MID-SESSION SAVE — API Smoke Tests + Frontend Phase 1-3A

### What Was Accomplished

**API Smoke Tests (17/17 passing):**
- Wrote `tests/integration/test_api_smoke.py` with 17 smoke tests covering all 14 API endpoints
- Fixed `httpx` 0.28 incompatibility with `starlette` 0.27 — downgraded to `httpx==0.27.0`
- Fixed `test_search_image` — 1x1 PNG caused CLIP channel confusion; replaced with 4x4 PIL-generated PNG
- All 17 tests green

**Frontend Phase 1 — Design System Alignment (COMPLETE):**
- **1.1** Swapped Playfair Display → Cormorant Garamond in `layout.tsx`, fixed CSS variable to `--font-serif`
- **1.2** Replaced entire Tailwind color palette: `vintage.*` → flat tokens (terracotta, gold, sage, cream, charcoal, etc.) + custom shadows + border radii
- **1.3** Populated `theme.ts` with PLATFORM_COLORS, PLATFORM_NAMES, SCORE_COLORS, scoreColorByValue()
- **1.4** Updated `globals.css`: `vintage-*` classes → new tokens, added gold scrollbar styles
- **1.5** Updated all 4 UI primitives (Button, Card, Badge, Input) to new color tokens
- **1.6** Added `images.remotePatterns` in `next.config.ts` for Met Museum, Smithsonian, Etsy CDNs
- Also fixed `tailwind.config.ts` line 41: `var(--font-cormorant)` → `var(--font-serif)`
- `npm run build` passes clean

**Frontend Phase 2 — Types & API Client (COMPLETE):**
- **2.1** Reconciled Product type: removed dead fields (color, season, year, period, pattern), added Fashionpedia taxonomy (12 fields)
- **2.2** Added 6 bridge interfaces: ProductSummary, BridgeResult, BridgeListResponse, BridgeTypeStats, ScoreHistogramBucket, BridgeStats
- **2.3** Added 8 API functions: getProductBridges, getModernEchoes, getStyleAncestry, getStyleSiblings, getTopBridges, getBridgeStats, getBridgeBetween, getBridgeDetail
- **2.4** Added DEFAULT_BRIDGE_LIMIT and FEATURED_BRIDGES_LIMIT constants
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors

**Frontend Phase 3A — Layout Components (COMPLETE):**
- **3A.1** Header: sticky, frosted glass, mobile hamburger / desktop nav links, `"use client"` for menu state
- **3A.2** Footer: 3-column grid (mobile: stacked), brand + nav + tech stack + copyright
- **3A.3** Navigation: skipped — Header already handles mobile nav
- **3A.4** Root layout: added Header/Footer imports, fixed `--font-serif` variable, updated metadata title/description
- `npm run build` passes clean

### Files Modified This Session

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `tests/integration/test_api_smoke.py` | Wrote 17 smoke tests, fixed image test |
| `vv-web/src/app/layout.tsx` | Font swap, Header/Footer, metadata, removed old color classes |
| `vv-web/tailwind.config.ts` | Full color palette replacement, shadows, border radii, font-serif variable |
| `vv-web/src/styles/theme.ts` | Populated with platform colors, score colors, scoreColorByValue |
| `vv-web/src/app/globals.css` | New color tokens, scrollbar styles |
| `vv-web/src/components/ui/Button.tsx` | vintage-* → terracotta/cream/border |
| `vv-web/src/components/ui/Card.tsx` | vintage-* → warm-white/border/muted |
| `vv-web/src/components/ui/Badge.tsx` | vintage-* → terracotta/sage/border |
| `vv-web/src/components/ui/Input.tsx` | vintage-* → border/muted/terracotta |
| `vv-web/next.config.ts` | Added remotePatterns for museum CDNs |
| `vv-web/src/types/index.ts` | Reconciled Product, added 6 bridge interfaces |
| `vv-web/src/lib/api.ts` | Added 8 bridge API functions |
| `vv-web/src/lib/constants.ts` | Added bridge limit constants |
| `vv-web/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` | Populated: sticky header with mobile/desktop nav |
| `vv-web/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` | Populated: 3-column responsive footer |

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Downgrade httpx to 0.27.0 | httpx 0.28 removed `app` kwarg that starlette 0.27 TestClient needs |
| 4x4 PIL PNG instead of hand-crafted 1x1 | CLIP misinterprets 1x1x3 as 1-channel image |
| Skip Navigation.tsx | Header already handles mobile nav dropdown; can upgrade to slide-in later |
| Flat color tokens (not nested) | `bg-terracotta` is shorter than `bg-vintage-burgundy` and matches Figma tokens |
| `--font-serif` not `--font-cormorant` | Standard convention; Tailwind's `font-serif` maps directly |

### Problems Hit

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `httpx` 0.28 broke TestClient | `pip install httpx==0.27.0` |
| CLIP ValueError on 1x1 PNG | Used PIL to generate 4x4 RGB PNG |
| `--font-cormorant` in layout vs `--font-serif` in tailwind config | Standardized on `--font-serif` everywhere |
| `bg-vintage-cream` still in layout.tsx body | Removed (already set in globals.css) |

RESUME POINT: Start implementing Phase 3B — search components (SearchBar.tsx, ImageUpload.tsx, ProductCard.tsx)

## Session Log: 2026-02-23 — Figma Design Capture + Frontend Implementation Plan

### What Was Accomplished

**Figma Design Population:**
- Created 5 standalone HTML pages in `figma-pages/` that visually match the design handoff (`docs/FIGMA_DESIGN_HANDOFF.md`)
- Served pages via Python HTTP server on port 8888
- Captured all 5 into Figma file `3AXCKfChPdugtQOQ5629BP` using `generate_figma_design` MCP tool
- Files created:
  - `figma-pages/design-system.html` — Color swatches, typography scale, spacing, radii, shadows
  - `figma-pages/components.html` — All UI components (badges, cards, search, buttons, layout)
  - `figma-pages/home-desktop.html` — Full home page at 1440px
  - `figma-pages/search-results-desktop.html` — Search results with 4-col product grid
  - `figma-pages/product-detail-desktop.html` — Product hero + bridge sections

**Frontend Implementation Plan:**
- Explored all 14 FastAPI backend endpoints and Pydantic schemas
- Explored all existing Next.js frontend files (types, API client, components, stubs)
- Created comprehensive mobile-first implementation plan: `docs/plans/FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Plan covers 5 phases, 41 files (13 modify, 6 populate, 22 create), with checklists and deliverables
- **User will implement this plan themselves** — not Claude

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Mobile-first design (390px base) | Primary audience is Gen Z / younger Millennials on phones |
| Cormorant Garamond replaces Playfair Display | Per Figma design handoff — more editorial, vintage-appropriate |
| New color tokens replace `vintage.*` namespace | Handoff specifies specific palette (terracotta, gold, sage, platform colors, score colors) |
| BridgeCardFull: stacked on mobile, side-by-side on desktop | Images need to be large enough to see detail on small screens |
| BridgeCardCompact: 240px mobile, 280px desktop | 240px allows peek effect in carousel (1.5 cards visible at 390px) |
| No code implementation by Claude | User explicitly said "i was going to do the implementation. i just need the plan" |

### Files Created This Session

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `figma-pages/design-system.html` | Design system showcase for Figma capture |
| `figma-pages/components.html` | Component library showcase for Figma capture |
| `figma-pages/home-desktop.html` | Home page mock for Figma capture |
| `figma-pages/search-results-desktop.html` | Search results mock for Figma capture |
| `figma-pages/product-detail-desktop.html` | Product detail mock for Figma capture |
| `docs/plans/FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | 5-phase mobile-first frontend implementation plan |

### Files Read But Not Modified

- `docs/FIGMA_DESIGN_HANDOFF.md` — Design tokens, components, page layouts
- `vv-web/src/lib/api.ts` — 4 existing API functions
- `vv-web/src/types/index.ts` — Product, SearchFilters, SearchResult types
- `vv-web/src/app/layout.tsx` — Playfair Display + Inter fonts
- `vv-web/tailwind.config.ts` — vintage.* color palette
- `vv-web/src/app/globals.css` — Base styles with vintage-* classes
- `vv-web/next.config.ts` — Empty config
- All existing component stubs in `vv-web/src/components/`

### What's Left Open

- **Frontend implementation** — User is doing this themselves using the plan doc
- **Figma refinement** — User said they're still refining the design
- **Bridge narratives** — Still 22/7,324 generated (needs `analysis/generate_narratives.py` run)
- **API smoke testing** — Endpoints still not tested against live services

## Session Log: 2026-02-21 + 2026-02-22 — FastAPI Backend Implementation

### What Was Accomplished

**Schemas (Day 1 — Feb 21):**
- Created `api/schemas/product.py` — `ProductSummary` (13 fields), `ProductDetail` (34 fields), `_parse_json_list()` helper
- Rewrote `api/schemas/search.py` — fixed syntax bugs, created `SearchFilters`, `TextSearchRequest`, `ImageSearchRequest`, `SearchResult`, `SearchResponse`
- Created `api/schemas/bridge.py` — `BridgeResult`, `BridgeListResponse`, `BridgeTypeStats`, `ScoreHistogramBucket`, `BridgeStats`
- Created `api/schemas/filters.py` — `FilterOptions` (8 list fields)
- Created `api/schemas/__init__.py` — re-exports all 13 schemas
- Fixed `api/__init__.py` — replaced broken `=` with empty file
- Fixed `tests/unit/test_bridge_logic.py` — updated stale import `scripts.analysis.compute_bridges` → `analysis.compute_bridges`

**Routers (Day 2 — Feb 22):**
- Wrote `api/routers/products.py` — 5 endpoints (get_product, product_bridges, modern_echoes, style_ancestry, style_siblings)
- Wrote `api/routers/bridges.py` — 4 endpoints (top_bridges, bridge_stats, bridge_between, bridge_detail)
- Wrote `api/routers/filters.py` — 1 endpoint (get_filters with 8 SELECT DISTINCT queries)
- Wrote `api/routers/search.py` — 2 endpoints (search_text with Qdrant filtering, search_image with base64 decode + CLIP)
- Wrote `api/dependencies.py` — `get_vector_db()` and `get_embedding_generator()` with `@lru_cache`
- Wrote `api/main.py` — FastAPI app wiring (CORS, 4 router includes, health endpoint)

**Infrastructure (Day 2 — Feb 22):**
- Modified `storage/vector_db.py` — added `query_filter` param to `search_similar()` for native Qdrant filtering
- Created `embeddings/scripts/backfill_image_payloads.py` — backfilled `vintage_images` payloads from 12 → 28 fields using `set_payload()`
- Modified `embeddings/scripts/generate_image_embeddings.py` — imports `build_full_payload()` so future runs include full payload
- Ran backfill script — both Qdrant collections now have identical payload shapes

**Documentation (Day 2 — Feb 22):**
- Created `docs/blog_first_api.md` — dev diary covering both days

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Aligned SearchFilters and FilterOptions to 8 identical fields | 1:1 mapping means filter dropdowns match exactly what search accepts |
| Removed 5 dead columns from all schemas (color, season, year, pattern, period) | 0/866 populated, superseded by enrichment fields |
| Native Qdrant filtering (Option B) over Python post-filtering | Cleaner, faster — Qdrant prunes before vector comparison |
| Backfilled vintage_images payloads instead of Postgres join in image search | Eliminates per-request DB join; both collections now identical |
| No lifespan function in main.py | Qdrant/embedding singletons handled by lru_cache in dependencies.py |
| No /api/v1 prefix on routes | Frontend calls endpoints directly (http://localhost:8000/search/text) |

### Problems Encountered

| Problem | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| `api/__init__.py` contained just `=` | Replaced with empty file |
| `api/schemas/search.py` had syntax bugs (`query = str`) | Rewrote from scratch |
| `tests/unit/test_bridge_logic.py` stale import path | Fixed `scripts.analysis.compute_bridges` → `analysis.compute_bridges` |
| `vintage_images` had 12 payload fields vs 28 in `vintage_text` | Wrote backfill script using `set_payload()` — no re-embedding needed |
| Route ordering — `/{bridge_id}` would match `/top` | Put `/top`, `/stats`, `/between/{a}/{b}` before `/{bridge_id}` |
| Function name shadowing in bridges router | Renamed endpoint functions (e.g., `top_bridges` not `get_top_bridges`) |
| bridge_queries functions use keyword-only args (`*`) | Must pass named params, not positional |

### What's Left Open
- Tests not yet run against the live API (user was running tests at end of session)
- `embedded_at` column still only set for 200/866 products (tracking gap, not data gap)
- 22/7,324 bridge narratives generated (need to run `generate_narratives.py`)
- Frontend search components are still stubs

---

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+ with venv
- Node.js 25+ with npm
- Supabase project (PostgreSQL + pgvector + Storage)
- Anthropic API key (for Claude enrichment/narratives)

### Python Environment

```bash
# Always use the venv — never system python
source venv/bin/activate
# Or reference directly:
venv/bin/python <script>
venv/bin/pytest tests/
```

### Environment Variables

File: `.env` (exists in project root)

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://postgres.<ref>:<password>@aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
SUPABASE_URL=https://<ref>.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=<service-role-key>
SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=product-images
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...  # Required for enrichment/narratives
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd vv-web
npm install    # First time only
npm run dev    # http://localhost:3000
```

### Run Tests

```bash
venv/bin/pytest tests/                    # Full suite
venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/               # Unit only (no DB needed)
venv/bin/pytest tests/integration/        # Needs Supabase PostgreSQL
venv/bin/pytest tests/data_integrity/     # Needs Supabase PostgreSQL
venv/bin/pytest tests/search_quality/     # Needs Supabase PostgreSQL
venv/bin/pytest -m "not slow"             # Skip slow tests
```

---

## Current State (2026-03-07)

### What Works

- **4,234 products** in Supabase PostgreSQL across 4 platforms (va_museum 1,856, fashionpedia 1,000, smithsonian 778, met_museum 600)
- **ALL 4,234 enriched** by Claude Sonnet 4 with 23 structured fields + core_vibes/bridge_vibes
- **ALL 4,234 text embeddings** + **ALL 4,234 image embeddings** in pgvector columns (HNSW indexed)
- **Bridge recomputation running** (`compute_bridges.py --rebuild`) — replacing old 3,367 bridges
- **6-dimensional bridge classification** designed and coded (pending classifier run)
- **Bridge query library** (`analysis/bridge_queries.py`) — supports 6 new dimension filters + `shared_function`
- **FastAPI backend** — 16 endpoints across 5 routers, 16 Pydantic schemas, pgvector search
- **Social Function Explorer API** — `/explore/functions` + `/explore/functions/{fn}`
- **Frontend COMPLETE** — Next.js 16 app: design system, layout, search, bridge components, 4 pages, polish
- **Supabase migration COMPLETE** — PostgreSQL + pgvector + Supabase Storage (all 20 steps done)

### What's In Progress

- **Bridge recomputation** — `compute_bridges.py --rebuild` running (775/4134 scanned at last check)
- **Bridge classification** — classifier script ready, waiting for bridge computation to finish

### What's Incomplete

- **Classifier run** — after bridges finish: `scripts/classify_bridge_dimensions.py --dry-run` then full run
- **Narrative regeneration** — after classifier: `analysis/generate_narratives.py` (now with mode hints)
- **Frontend updates** — social function explorer page, bridge card connection mode badges, bridge filtering UI
- **Image search frontend** — Backend API exists, frontend not yet implemented

### What's Not Started

- **Deployment** — Supabase + Railway + Vercel
- **Knowledge Graph** — plans written, prerequisites partly done

## Known Gotchas

1. **Always use `venv/bin/python`** — system Python won't have the packages.

2. **`embedded_at` is misleading** — only 200/866 products have this timestamp, but all 866 have pgvector embeddings. Don't filter by `embedded_at IS NOT NULL` to find "embedded" products.

3. **Bridge canonical ordering** — `source_id < target_id` always. When looking up a bridge between products A and B, use `min(A,B)` as source and `max(A,B)` as target.

4. **`bridge_narrative` not `narrative`** — The column is `bridge_narrative`. Earlier code/docs may reference just `narrative`.

5. **Embedding model loading is slow** — First import of `embeddings.models` downloads ~500MB of model weights. Subsequent loads are cached.

6. **JSON fields in Postgres** — `style_tags`, `colors`, `textile_finishing`, `garment_parts`, `decorations`, `image_urls` are all `Text` columns storing JSON strings, not JSONB. Parse with `json.loads()`.

7. **Score distribution is tight** — Fashion corpus items cluster closely in embedding space. The minimum bridge score threshold is 0.30 and the average is 0.556. Don't expect scores as spread out as general-purpose search.

8. **`generate_bridge_narrative` max_tokens=200** — Was 100 originally, caused truncation. If narratives are still truncating, increase this.

9. **Old 866 products have stale text embeddings** — Embedded from title+description, not enriched_text. Need re-embedding after enrichment pipeline stabilizes.

10. **V&A products enrichment in progress** — `test_all_products_are_enriched` will fail until all 4,234 products are enriched (1,490/4,234 as of 2026-03-06).

---

## Priorities for Next Session

### Immediate (Bridge Pipeline Completion)

1. **Wait for `compute_bridges.py --rebuild`** to finish (currently running)
2. **Run classifier dry-run** — `venv/bin/python scripts/classify_bridge_dimensions.py --dry-run` — review distribution
3. **Run classifier** — `venv/bin/python scripts/classify_bridge_dimensions.py` — populate 6 dimension columns
4. **Generate narratives** — `venv/bin/python analysis/generate_narratives.py` — new narratives get mode-specific hints

### Frontend Updates

5. **Social Function Explorer page** — `/explore/functions` (landing + detail views)
6. **Bridge card enhancements** — connection mode badges (contrast/resonance/affinity), axis pills
7. **Bridge filtering UI** — dimension toggles on bridges/top view
8. **Frontend TypeScript types** — add new bridge fields + explore API types

### After Pipeline Complete

9. **Deployment** — Supabase + Railway + Vercel
10. **Knowledge Graph implementation** — plans in `docs/plans/KG_IMPLEMENTATION/`
11. **Image search frontend** — Connect `searchByImage` API to frontend UI
